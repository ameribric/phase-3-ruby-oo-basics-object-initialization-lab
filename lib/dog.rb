#   snoopy = Dog.new

#   Let's define an #initialize 
#   method that takes in an argument of a dog's breed
#   and sets a @breed variable equal to that argument
# # this below is doing what above is asking for 
#   class Dog
#     attr_reader :breed
  
#     def initialize(breed)
#       @breed = breed
#     end
